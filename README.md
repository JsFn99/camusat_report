# camusat_report

## Introduction

This project is part of an internship at **Camusat Telcam**, designed to create a mobile application for managing and documenting site inspections. The app allows users to gather technical data, upload photos, and generate comprehensive reports to improve project oversight and auditing processes.

## Purpose

The goal of the app is to provide a robust and user-friendly tool for field technicians to document site inspections efficiently. It supports real-time data entry, file management, and report generation, ensuring seamless workflow integration for site inspections.

## Key Features

- **Data Entry & Management**: Allows users to input detailed building information, including geographical data, equipment status, and more.
- **Photo Capture & Upload**: Users can take site photos or upload existing images directly into the app, associating them with building data.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically compiles collected data into structured PDF reports.
- **Persistent Local Storage**: Saves data locally to ensure work continuity even when offline.
- **Search & List**: Quickly find and review building inspections using search filters.

## Development Environment

- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Language**: Dart
- **Platforms**: iOS & Android
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
- **Version Control**: GitHub
